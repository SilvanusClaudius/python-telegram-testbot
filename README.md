# python-telegram-testbot
A basic bot that randomly selects entries from a database or data store

Originally made to help students revise for their upcoming examinations, so the bot is structured to be able to let them select which topic they wish to be tested in.

I used MySQL as a datastore but the code can be modified to use a csv instead to make management simpler.
